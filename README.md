# Stixx
Stixx is an up and coming two-player game where the objective of the game is
to deplete your opponent of their sticks. Players start with a stick in each of
their hands and add sticks to the opponent based on how many sticks they
currently have. If either player gets exactly five sticks, they lose said hand.

# Overview
Stixx is childhood game that many of us have played under different names or
rules. The purpose of this project is to give back the nostalgia that this
childhood game gave us. The current plan is to have a bare-bones UI of the game
that works. There are also exciting plans in for future of this game.
